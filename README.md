## Abstract
This project implements the Apriori algorithm for association rule mining on a Dementia Patient Health Dataset containing 9,835 patient records. Key findings include associations between hypertension, obesity in specific age groups, and low cognitive function with lift values up to 2.3. The analysis pipeline includes data preprocessing (handling missing values and feature engineering), exploratory data analysis (EDA), rule generation, and evaluation using support, confidence, lift, leverage, and conviction metrics. Clinical insights and actionable recommendations for dementia risk assessment are derived from the strongest rules identified in the dataset.
